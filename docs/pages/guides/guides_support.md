Developers that use the File API or other Youforce APIs can use this community to talk with

* Visma developers that design and implement these APIs
* Visma consultant that help to connect with customer environments
* Other File API consumers

You can join [here](https://vismadevelopers.slack.com/shared_invite/zt-jn8iy6oy-mig~~X_F1YQItsQQ2R7_fQ#/). Anyone can join!

Each Youforce API has it's own channel starting with #youforce. The File API channel is **#youforce-file-api**.
